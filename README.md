# Followmeter-for-instagram

## Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a third-party web application that helps Instagram users gain a deeper understanding of their profile activity. By using the app, users can identify several aspects of their Instagram account that aren’t readily available through Instagram’s native interface. The app will display key metrics such as who isn’t following back, users who have blocked the account, new followers, and more. It will offer a clear overview of a user's relationship with their followers and interactions, enhancing social media management.

## Key Features:

Unfollow Tracker: Displays users who are not following back.

Blockers Tracker: Identifies users who have blocked the profile.

Unknown Followers: Shows users who follow the account but have not been followed back.

Blocked Users Overview: Lets users see who they have blocked.

New Followers Tracker: Displays newly gained followers over a specific time period.

Instagram Profile Integration: Securely connects to Instagram accounts via OAuth for easy data fetching.


## Tech Stack:



**Frontend:**

React for building the user interface.

CSS or Tailwind CSS for styling.

Axios for making API requests.

Redux for state management.


**Backend:**

Use Node.js for the backend server logic.

Use Express.js to handle HTTP requests and routes.

Integrate JavaScript to interact with external APIs 

Others:

Instagram API (or third-party APIs) for fetching the user’s profile data


## Why This Project:


I chose this project because it combines both a useful functionality and the potential for learning new skills in web development. Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, and many users are often interested in tracking and managing their followers and interactions in a more efficient way. This app would cater to those needs, giving them a comprehensive view of their Instagram profile.

Moreover, this project is valuable because it solves a common problem that many social media users face — understanding their profile metrics and interactions with ease. Through building this app, I will deepen my knowledge of frontend technologies like React, learn to work with APIs (specifically Instagram’s API), and strengthen my backend skills with Node.js and Express. It also provides a great opportunity to practice OAuth authentication and ensure security within the app.
